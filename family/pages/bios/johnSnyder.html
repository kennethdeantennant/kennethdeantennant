								was united in marriage to Barbara Krueger, the home being in Missouri throughout the Civil War, in which 
								Mr. Snyder served actively for three years, bravely and with honor.
								<p>
								In 1871 the family moved to Oakland, Nebraska where they resided until 1891when they removed to 
								Broken Bow, which was their home until moving to Scottsbluff.  Seven children were born to the union, 
								five of these together
								with their faithful wives survive to morn the loss of losing husband and father.  They are Peter, Jefferson 
								City, Mo., John A. of Oconto, Nebr., Mrs. Margaret Uehling, of Uehling, Nebr., Andrew M. of Corvallis, Ore.
								, and Conrad B. of Scottsbluff,  all the children being here except Peter.
								<p>
								The funeral services will be held in the Methodist church at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow, Rev. Fintel officiating.  
								Mr. Snyder and wife have been members of the Methodist church for the past 23 years.
								<p>
								Carolyn Snyder Downey's grandmother (Della Slates Snyder) wrote the following.  Carolyn has the 
								information in Della's handwriting.
								<p>
								"Barbara and John Snyder lived about 12 miles from Jefferson City for about 14 years.  Then they moved 
								to a farm soutwest of Oakland, Nebraska, where they lived about 10 years.  It is near this farm home in a 
								little rural cemetery that Barbara's father, Bartholomus Krueger, is buried.  This is on the tombstone:  
								Bartholomus Krueger died August 20, 1881, age 65 years.  This is Conrad's mother's father.
								<p>
								"Bartholomus Krueger and wife, Mary Dingle, came from Germany, spending six weeks on the ocean.  
								They settled at Jefferson City, Missouri.  They had four children:  Adam, Barbara, John, and Maggie.  In
