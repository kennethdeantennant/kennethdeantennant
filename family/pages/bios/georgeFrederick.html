								<P>In the year l856, I with my mother left our native land, England, with about 600 others for our Mecca, the Zion of our God, on the good ship Orizon
								spending 5 weeks in our voyage to Boston; where we took passage upon a river steamboat to Iowa, awaiting there for three weeks for our Hand
								Carts to be made that we were to carry our all across the vast stretch of the plains to Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each family supplying themselves with the necessary
								food for their journey there if all were well.</P>
								
								
								<P>At Iowa City, Iowa where we were camped, a gentleman told me that we would starve to death if we went there at this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our people
								and his family decided to stay over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became tempted to do likewise and upon telling my mother that we had better stay, she became much
								depressed in spirit and told me to wait for a little while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time, she prayed to our heavenly father for guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fellow traveler after
								deciding to stay went out one day to hunt in the woods for game, and while away was seized with the fever and argew, he hurried home and upon
								entering his tent, where Mother and I were awaiting him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laid on the cot and commenced to sing in poetry and rhyme telling Mother to take me
								with her to the valley and that we should get there alright.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared all this time to be in a queer stupor or comates state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother then told me
								she had made it a matter of prayer and by this means her prayers were answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then told her that we would go to the valley at all hazzards
								because I was satisfied all would be well.</P>
								
								
								<P>Upon the company starting we were in line with our cart and ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All went well with us as we joyously sang, for some must push and some must
								pull, as we go marching up the hill, as merrily on the way we go, until we reach the valley oh--h.</P>
								
								
								<P>As days wore on, our spirits lagged as we became weary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our people becoming sick, were compelled to ride, thus compelling others to be
								more heavily loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions commencing to get scarce as the days wore on necessitating our captain to place us on shorter rations; many dying
								by the wayside where they were buried each night where we camped and their graves were left unmarked except by our tears.</P>
								
								
								<P>At this season of year, and in that part of the plains the weather commenced to be cold and we were again placed on shorter rations of 4 ounces of
								flour to each person per day.</P>
								
								
								<P>We traveled to the sweet water river where we camped being so weak and exhausted that it was almost impossible to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our people
								while there died of starvation, while some froze to death by the wayside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man by the name of Stone from London while trying to get to an Indian
								Camp was devoured by wolves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When found by some of our camp nothing was left of him but his legs inside his boots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescuers was sent out from
								the Valley to assist us, and they found us thinking we were lost on the plains the rescue party concluded to return to the valley, but one of their
								number declared he would go to the states but what he would find us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About noon a horseman was seen coming into our camp and he looked like an
								Angel to us poor starving emigrants, who had eaten nothing except flour for <EM>3 </EM>days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With words of encouragement he entreated us to make another
								start, but many, while their will was good their strength  failed them and drooped and froze to death by the wayside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relief party returned and
								met us and assisted us with some provisions, but scores of our Brethren and sisters died and were left in unmarked graves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I was
								permitted to sleep in a tent with two of my companions each each of them dying by the side where I slept by them until morning when they were
								taken away and buried.</P>
								
								
								<P>In a later trip across the plains to assist the emigrants, at one of our camps I saw many of the bones of my companions that had been dug up by
								wolves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the death of my companions I, became so despondent through weakness that I longed for death and tried to hide myself from
								the company that I might die; but one of the brethren returning back for something found me sitting behind a rock where I had hoped to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
								took me along with him for a day before we caught up with the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was permitted to sleep in a wagon that night, where I slept with a dead
								man all night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day we were permitted to see and enter into the valley although I was too weak to walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet being much swollen I
								wrapped them in my mothers shawl until we were taken care of by kind friends awaiting us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I being young was so hungry that I could have eaten
								everything before me but Brother Hack, our kind friend would allow me only a limited amount of bread and butter as he was afraid it would kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								But the next day they had a pot pie on the fire for the family, Brother Hack went up into town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished up the whole pie and am alive yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I
								have been hungry up to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long before dinner will be ready, I am almost starved now.</P>

								<P>My grandfather was George Frederick Housley, who was born on 29 November l826 in Sutton, Ashfeild, Notes, England.</P>
								
								
								<P>His father was Charles Douben Housley and his mother was Harriet Agnes Cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother left his father in England and sailed with her family of at
								least two sons to America one was my grandfather, George Frederick Housley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landing in Boston we made the journey to Salt Lake City, Utah,
								whore we lived a short time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later moving to Drapewill, Utah where I went to work for a farmer by the name of Shepley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was while there I met my
								future wife I Maria.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been sent to live with these people where she was to be raised as their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was only 14 years old at the time and
								these people were not treating her as they should and were letting their own children make all manner of fun of her because she couldn't speak their
								language.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt so badly about this that she prayed to the Lord and ask him to help her to forget the Danish language which she did forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Grandfather had left a sweet heart in England, who had refused to come to America and so he married my grandmother at just 14 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this
								union was born 12 children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my mother was just a small child her mother had developed dropsy and Phueumatiain and so raised the balance of
								the family in this condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was only in her fifties when she passed away leaving grandfather to care for 4 small children</P>
								
								
								<P>Later on he married Mary Ann Barron, who had several children and they later on had 3 more and 1 boy.</P>
								
								
								<P>Grandfather moved to Paradise, Cache County, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he was married and while there he sang in the choir when ever ho could get to church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never were blessed with to much of this worlds good and both he and his wife were very proud people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However they taught their children the
								Gospel and tried to keep them as active as they could in the Gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight of their children were married in the temple and two went later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
								died as a baby and the youngest passed away some time ago with out this privilege.</P>
								
								
								<P>Grandfather came across the plain in the Martin and Tayer Handcart Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was 19 years old at the time and grandmother came in the
								Independent Company and was just 8 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was baptized in Drapervill, Utah.</P>
								
								
								<P>He was a war veteran and Indian Scout and also a freighter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought the paper from St. Lewis, Missouri by freight wagons that the first Deseret
								News was printed on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He established the first wollen mills in Cache County and was also a mail carrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made to trips to Winter Quarters to living
								immigrants to Salt Lake by handcart, and later on was one of the few who had the privilege of having his record endowments in the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
								passed away in June of 1915.</P>
								
								
								<P>Grandfather was married in the old endowment house 22 February 1862.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time just prior to the birth of their first child this old sweet heart
								who had remained in England came to America and sought out grandfather, who was truly surprised to see her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still was in love with him and so
								was willing to become his second wife, but my grandmother just couldn't see it that way and so they waited for awhile and a short time later this
								young women, whose name was Emma took ill and passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the other children came to this union grandfather wanted to name one girl after
								this sweetheart and so finally after a time grandmother gave her consent and the next baby girl was named Emma.</P>
