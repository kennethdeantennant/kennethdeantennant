								It was very hot and dry in Nebraska in August (14), 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Grandmother was attending my Mother and when she delivered my Grandmother
								took care of us both. This was Grandma Flossie Meeker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Grandfather Meeker lived about a mile down the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berwyn, Custer County,
								Nebraska.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, Howard Wayne Tennant--Mother Jessie Almira Meeker.<p></P>
								<P>I -- 1940-41</P>
								<P>My earliest memories of childhood are of my first years in school in Eerwyn, Keb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school had two rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One room had all the grade school, 1
								thru 7; the other was grades 8 thru 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each row of seats was a grade with a play house in the corner of the room for the snail children (me, 1st
								grade).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school sat at the end of Main St.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used that hill for sleding in the winter time.</P>
								
								<P>My brother Morrell and I received a sled for Christmas one year and the next sumrrer I didnt think we needed it any more so I traded it for apocket
								knife and some marbles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, that wasnt the proper thing to do so after I got my bottom beat severly I hadto take the knife and the
								marbles back and get the sled.</P>
								
								<P>On the first of May we used to xtake kay Baskets, fill them with treats and deliver ther: to friends and people we were fond of.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iKorrell and I had
								made a few and Dad was toking us t~ town to deliver them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were riding in the rumble seat of the car when it staled on a small hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother
								and I jumbed out of the rumble seat to help push.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caught my foot on something and fell under the car--it backed over me pinning me under it for
								sometime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pretty sore and bruised for a while afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We did go ahead and deliver our may baskets).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we lived here I was also
								thrown from a horse while herding cattle for Dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was hurt pretty bad that time too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put me to bed for a long while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fell out a car door
								on our way to school, but this time it was in a soft snow bank so I wasnt injured badly.</P>
								
								<P>In Aproximately 1941--42 we moved to Twin Falls, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time the family consisted of Mom and Dad, my older brother Morrel Omar,
								myself, sister flargaret, brother Howard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We moved to Twin with our cousins the Ochsner Family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two families in one car and an old 4 wheel
								trailer for belongings (Bad Trip).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrived in Twin Falls and lived in a small one--room house on Grandmother Tennants property.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were
								six Tennants and six Ochsners (12 in all) in that one room, 9 x 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended grade school at Lincoln School--2nd, 5rd and 4th--Moved to
								Washington Courts and attended Washington 5th and 6th grades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period the W~orld War 2 was going on and times were hard for
								everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All goods were rationed, Gas, Tires, Prestone, anything to do with automobiles, as well as food----all canned goods and especially fresh
								meat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most food was grown at home and consumed there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gardens were called Vi~ctory Gardens As kids we collected string, aluminum, wire,
								anything metal, paper, cardboard, cloth, nothing was wasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was all turned in to help the ~ar cause.</P>
								
								<P>Mom and Dad both worked hard during this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad worked days and they both worked nights cleaning a local bakery and Mom cleaned houses
								for other people during the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a lot of baby sitting of my brothers and sisters and house cleaning at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took all of us to make a living.
								By this time another brother (Jack) ond a sister (Reva Jean) had been born.</P>
								
								<P>I started working in a bean house when I was 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work was heavy and days were long but it taught me how to work and not to be fussy about
								what I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I started working I never had trouble finding a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had farmers calling for me to come work for them on their combines during
								harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As kids we did a lot of work on farms during the harvest season the main reason being at that time school would let out for two weeks so</P>
								
								<P>e kids could help get the crops in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time the farm jobs have gotten scarce and the population of young people has grown and so when they
								let the kids out for harvest vacation---too many of them were causing problems in town so they have done away with this school vacation time.</P>
								
								<P>I participated in some sports in junior high but nothing to really talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite one to play was soccor and baseball because I liked to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
								also enjoyed track.</P>
								
								<P>I learned from my Grandmother Tennant to use what other people throw away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I scent a lot of time going through other peoples garbage cans
								picking out usable items (not food).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would pick up an item and my imagination would start to work as to what I could do with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems rather
								crude, but it was fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that but it helped me in my different employment to use this imagination of mine.</P>
								
								<P>II -- March, 1951 I met your mother Helen Neilson on the play ground at Lincoln School.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and a girl friend were in the swings on the
								playground next to the sidewalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on my way to the show and I stopped to talk with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to get a date with morns friend, (she went
								with me once, but wasnt interested), so mom and I made a date and then she stood me up.</P>
								
								<P>Just a short while after we started dating I went off to work in the Stanley Basin at a Dude Ranch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked there all that summer, helped build a
								log cabin, worked with horses and a lot of city folk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I packed people in to lakes and sec1&uuml;~d spots for vacations on horseback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a lot of hard
								work but fun and a great experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a great deal about people and survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was especially fun when Mom and her friends and my
								family came to visit me.</P>
								
								<P>III -- Going back a little ways again I remember one time my brother Morrel and I on a sunday borrowed Dads car and took some friends
								of ours to Sun Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was a 1956 Chevy (Grandad Tennants old car).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were only suoposed to go on the other side of town for a few
								hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way home from Sun Valley we burned the motor out on the car because we didnt check the oil and it ran dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We called Dad from
								Shoshone to come and get us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh was he mad and Mom was scared; she thought we had died in.a car crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we got home he got a board and
								beat our bottoms till he broke the board and we couldnt sit down, then we had to tear the motor down and rebuild it and further more
								couldnt go anywhere til it was done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we got to stay home for several weeks after that.</P>
								
								<P>After we came to Idaho from Nebraska I lived with my Aunt and Uncle in Hansen and helped around their grocery store and gas station.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
								had a good time living with them, I ate very well and got a lot of attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remember while I was there, I had a friend stay with me for
								a couple of days and while he was there we picked all the old rotten apricots from under a tree and threw them at cars in the parking
								lot and at ones that drove by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well----we got caught real fast and had to wash 5 cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I went back to Twin to Mom and Dad,
								Grace and Mann took me to Yellowstone Park with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was probably around 1945--44, Im not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met my first bear real
								close.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to get in the back seat of the car with me and their dog Corky.</P>
								
								<P>As a young boy I used to go around Twin Falls mowing lawns to earn money and doing odd jobs for
								people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a school teacher that felt sorry for me because I was so skinny so she would ask
								me to come to her house to mow the lawn and do other jobs and then she would feed me to
								fatten me up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took advantage of that and ate real good there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Her husband had a lot of
								money).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a very nice lady and her name was Mrs.Grey.</P>
								
								<P>The summer before I started working in the bean warehouse I spent the time with my Grandfather and
								Grandmother Meeker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They worked as part of a section crew on the railroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes they would be
								in Twin but other times they went out of town and I recall one time I went with them to Logan and
								Brigham City, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Logan one day they allowed me the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you have to realize I
								never spent time in a movie to see it once thru, it was at least always twice and sometimes more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
								time I stayed twice and Grandfather did not agree with my methods----there goes another beating.
								Sounds like I got v:y share of those doesnt it? Well, anyway I did enjoy this different living experience
								with my grandparents.</P>
								
								<P>I remember when I was a young man and baby sitting my brothers and sisters while Mom and Dad worked out, I would get the dishes and the
								housework done and then I would sit the kids down and tell them how I was going to work hard and make lots of money then buy a shiney new
								convertible and take thea everywhere they wanted to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I grew older I did buy a convertible but of course it wasnt new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was fun just
								the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact dun my life time I have had four of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also by this time another brother, Robert, had Veen born.</P>
								
								<P>When I got acquainted with your mother Helen it was 1951 and I was sixteen at the time and she was eighteen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dated quite a lot to start and
								then went steady for about 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helens family did not like me at all so things went kind of slow for us for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided we wanted
								to be married but Mother Neilson had other ideas because I wasnt a member of the Mormon Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was upsetting to both of us so I joined
								the Marine Corps and soon left for San Diego and Boot Camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mom and I were still in love and still wanted to be married.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We corresponded
								all through boot camp training and when I got home that first time in spite of Mother Neilsons objections we packed our clothes, borrowed a car
								and went to Elko, Nevada to be married.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\'.'e didnt stay in Elko though, we came back to Twin Falls and stayed at my Uncle Ians Motel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week
								later I had to go back to California and from there to Japan for 14 months, and Mom went back to live with her mother till I returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother
								Neilson warmed up to the situation when Michael was born in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though our marriage wasnt what it should hove been, I loved Helen
								then as I do now and it doesnt take away from the love I feel for like, Debbie, Leanne and Dorinda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are very special people and I love you
								very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Incidently, my youngest brother Chanley was born 18 mos earlier than Mike)</P>
								
								<P>When I returned from Japan I was stationed in Calif.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Camp Pendleton) Oceanside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom and Mike joinQd me there and we started living
								together as a family in 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debra was born in a navel hosnital at Camp Pendleton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she was a tiny little girl and we were happy and
								proud----only it was very, very hot that August.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lived in a small trailer on the base until Jan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25, 1956.</P>
								
								<P>When I was discharged in 1956, we loaded all our belongings in and on top of our 1949 Chevy two door and headed for Twin Falls and home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
								had been raining for some time and was still at it by the time we got out of Calif.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our belongings on top of the car was wet even though we had
								them covered with a tarp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had forgotten it was Jan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and freezing in Nev.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Idaho and our car didnt have a heater in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We bundled up Mike
								and Debbie nice and warm and made a bed for them in the back seat of the car and ~tet out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drove and Mom scraped ice off the inside of the
								windshield so I could see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it as far as Ely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevada befor we couldnt stand any more and stopped for a warm bed and some much needed
								rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about two in the morning and we were nearly froze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day we made it on hone and very happy to be there.</P>
								
								<P>We rented a small apartment attached to the rear of a Motel on Kimberly Road and I went to work in a service station, from there we purchased a
								house on 2nd Ave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I went to work for a contractor helping build the Lynwood Subdivision and shopping center.</P>
								
								<P>From there we moved to Quincy Street and I went to work for 7--Up Bottling Co., driving t!uck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while we had a chance to build a house
								on Sunrise in East Twin Falls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was to do all the painting inside and out and mom was pregnant with Leanne, so she couldnt help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would work
								from 5 in the morning till 5 or 6 at night and run home for dinner and then go to our new house and work till midnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night Leanne was
								born I went home and had dinner and asked morn if everything was OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She assured me it was so I went on over to the new house to paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About
								midnight Uncle Darwin caine in and talked for a minute and then asked if I had cigars to pass out for the birth of mynew baby daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so
								surprised and happy I dropped everything and took off for the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom said she knew she was going to the hospital that night but she
								wanted to get in the new house so bad she let me go on to work without saying anything and had the neighbor man (a good friend of many years)
								take her to the hospital when she was ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got to the hospital and to the nursery and saw Leanne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a very pretty girl and special.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
								loved her and sure was happy.</P>
								
								<P>We moved from Quincy to our new home on Sunrise and I went to work for Safeway Stores in 1959.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were happy with our family and our new
								home and especially happy cause Mom was pregnant with Dorinda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a few years there th~t mom had to work out to help with financial
								problems and living expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She worked at Key Realty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day finally came that Dorinda was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rmember it was two nights before and
								New years Eve and we were out to a party with the other store employees and we had a real disagreement over my conduct which I agree wasnt
								good so I made a bad evening for both o~ us, but the next day was New Years and a Sunday, things were much better between us and we thought
								this was going to be it, but they waited another day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all got tc see our new baby on T.V..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed she and mom on the news and pictures
								in the newspaper as the New Year Baby it was auite e xcieting around town for awhile after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in town knew her and us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was
								pretty special person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We love her very much.</P>
								
								<P>From Sunrise we moved to the red house on 6th Ave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on to Polk, then to 6th Ave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North, to Boise, back to Twin Falls on Polk, to the
								red house on 6th East, then the green house on 6th Ave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East, then back to Boise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both times we rented in Boise was on Agate Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to gain
								a little more room as the children were growing older we moved to Peasley.</P>
								
								<P>In Boise, I worked for Safeway Stores, K--Mart Store, driving for Clover Club Potato Chips then started driving truck for Associated Foods;
								meanwhile we built a new house on Palouse.</P>
								
								<P>Mike and Debra at this time were in high school at Borah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leanne was at South Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High and Dorinda was at Whitney.</P>
								
								<P>In 1972 I became active in the church and mom and I took our family to the temple in Ogden, Utah on Dec.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the most beautiful time of
								my life and Im sorry I hant done it in the begining.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we went to the temple Mike also received his endowments to go on his mission
								to Sweden so when we returned from Ogden, the whole family participated in a Missionary Farewell and Sacrament meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very nice
								and we all felt very close.</P>
								
								<P>In March 1975 we were offered the job as caretakers at Pinetop Canip in the mountains 40 miles northeast of Boise on highway 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took it and moved our family to the
								mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These times were hard on all of us because of the distance to town and the lack of money, (we were only making $500.O0 a month).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leanne and Dorinda had it the toughest
								because they had to drive back and forth to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would start their journey at 5:00 A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and get home sometimes as late as 10:00 at night.</p>
								
								<P>It was also at this time that Debra met, fell in love and married Mark Sorensen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were married at Pinetop on the lawn; a beautif\il setting.
								They were later married in the temple at ProvO, Utah.</P>
								
								<P>We stayed at Pinetop until May, 1976.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning the girls hit a deer on the road with the car and almost sent them over a cliff into a canyon, so
								we decided wed better move back to town before they were killed driving that road.</P>
								
								<P>We moved to Virginia Street in Boise and took up our life in the city again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leanne and Dorinda continued their schooling at Boise High.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went
								to work at an Auto Body Shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later some close friends of ours called us and asked if we would like to look rifter their home in the mountains
								while they went on a mission for the church to Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they were to work with the Lamanites, so we moved back to the mountains to live
								for 18 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we were at this place on Daggett Creek Leanne left home after graduating, for Ricks College and I went to work for M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W.
								Markets.</P>
								
								<P>We moved again after 18 months to a 14X70 Trailer on App1e Street owned by Mark and Debbie Sorensen and Helen went to work for Associated
								Dairies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was while we were there at Christmas time we were expecting Leanne home from school and much to our surprise the police brought
								us word she had been in an accident and was in the hospital in Gooding, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cousin was bringing her home when this accident occured.
								Luckily neither one of them were hurt seriously.</P>
								
								<P>After we had lived in the trailer a little while Martin and Ann Zachreson were called on a mission with their family to California for 5 years and
								we agreed to stay in their home and look after it, so we moved to 5696 Plymouth Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was Dorindas senior year in high school so she
								finished this last year at Capital High.</P>
								
								<P>In July of 1979 we were called by a person closely connected with PineTop, to ask us if we would be interested in going back there to be
								caretakers again to get the place back in shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in a bEd state of repairs and some of the people involved were considering selling the camp.
								We felt like they were calling for help so we agreed to move back arid do what we could to help out the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We moved back in October and
								started to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom and 1 both worked very hard together to kee~ the camp from being sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the first year was up their was no more talk
								of selling the camp and all the members of the 8 stakes agreed the camp had done a complete turn around and all were happy with our efforts and
								the feelings of the members of the church had brightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sure dont make any money doing this but we sure did acquire a lot of friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
								things that have been accomplished by us here at Pinetop will live long after we have gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put a lot of our hearts and souls into this
								place, and I would like to say that n~ of this could have been done without the support of our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am eternally grateful to each of them for
								the many sacrifices they had to make on our behalf and I love them for it.</P>
								
								<P>I grew up in a family that has never shown any kind of outward affection for each other from Grandparents right thru to me, so I have never
								known how to express myself in that manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im sorry for this but th~its the way it is, even though I try to react differently it always seems there
								is something holding me back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive always had an inferiorority complex I could never get over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive always felt the best way to show my love was
								to work hard all the time to provide the things my family needed to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the lack of education the only way I could accomplish this was
								to work 2 or 5 jobs at a time which I know now wasnt the right thing to do because it took away from the family the thing that was needed the
								most; a fathers love, guidance, and outward showing of love and emotions in the home.</P>
								
								<P>I love each one of my children as individuals and as a family and I pray to God that they will take a close look at my life and see my mistakes and
								try not to make the same ones I did.</P>
								
								<P>I am not proud of some of the things I have done in my life but I am proud of my family and I feel I have come along way in the right direction
								from my first existence; not saying my young Life with my parents and brothers and sisters was bad, just different because they did not have the
								Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do love my parents and brothers and sisters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother passed away in August of 1971.</P>
								
								<P>I do feel however, that the life I have today could not have been had it not been for my loving wife and eternal companion Heien.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has always
								been a wonderful wife, mother and homemaker and a constant inspiration to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also a very nice looking lady with a beautiful spirit and a personality you have to fall in love with, thats why she has no enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always insists on helping anyone
								less fortunate than her.</P>
								
								<P>I feel the Lord has blessed me with far more than I deserve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the Lord and my family and I pray that those who read this will be able to
								understand me a little better and the way I do things.</P>
								
								
								<P>I LOVE YOU ALL - DAD</p>
