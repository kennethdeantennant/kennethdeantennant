								"Barbara and John Snyder lived about 12 miles from Jefferson City for about 14 years.  Then they moved 
								to a farm southwest of Oakland, Nebraska, where they lived about 10 years.  It is near this farm home in a 
								little rural cemetery that Barbara's father, Bartholemus Krueger, is buried.  This is on the tombstone:  
								Bartholemus Krueger died August 20, 1881, age 65 years.  This is Conrad's mother's father.
								<p>
								"Bartholemus Krueger and wife, Mary Dingle, came from Germany, spending six weeks on the ocean.  
								They settled at Jefferson City, Missouri.  They had four children:  Adam, Barbara, John, and Maggie.  In 
								1849 Bartholemus left his family and joined the many others going west to seek fame and fortune.  The 
								gold rush was on.  He was gone about 20 years, and in the meantime, his wife died and his children had 
								grown up.  The youngest son, John, while still young, also went west to seek that fortune and fame.  He 
								never did return to Missouri but remained in California.
