								My mother was the seventh child of my grandfather and grandmother, George Frederick and Maria Christina Jacobsen Housley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born 1 march
								1873 in the small town of Paradise Cache, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this place, she received her education and grew to young girlhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being from a large family who
								were not blessed with too much of this worlds goods, she decided to go away to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had an older sister by the name of Harriet Wilson living in
								Ogden, Utah who had three children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother went to help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When about 14 years old while living here she met and fell in love with my father Mr.
								Lorenzo Farley Sr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a courtship of one year, they were married in Ogden, Utah on 1 September 1888. <p></P>
								
								 
								<P> My father was a black smith and wheelwright by trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same trade as his father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year, I was born being the oldest of the family of six sisters
								and six brothers making a family of 13 children of whom eight are living. </P>
								
								 
								<P> I remember my mother first as being a medium sized woman with light blue eyes and a fair complexion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had long dark brown hair and a wonderful
								sunny disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind and loving, and was a devout woman true to the religion in which she had been raised and taught from infancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard her
								often say how she worshiped her father, mother, and brother and sisters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother was always kind to my father and to us children, often sacrificing
								her pleasures in life for us. </P>
								
								 
								<P> My father was a latter-day saint coming from a large polygamist family, but he was somewhat neglectful of his duties in the church, which caused some
								friction in their married life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that father was not a good father and husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother had an awful lot of hardships and disappointments in her life
								time, but she did a wonderful lot of good in raising so large a family and made a lot of friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left home at the age of 13 to work for my mother's
								brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was away from home a year and a half.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was away, my parents moved to Blackfoot, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father had a shop there for a while, and
								they moved several times on account of fathers work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother never complains so far as I know except when father left her so much at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left home
								to be married in 1910 and shortly after moved to California so I did not see mother as often as I should in her later years. </P>
								
								 
								<P> Father passed away in 1916 leaving her to raise and care for the large family of eight at home which she did by nursing and being caretaker of the school
								in the town of Parker, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She later moved to Twin Falls, Idaho and continued to nurse and helped to bring children into the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never
								remarried and lived to the good age of 82 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good and wonderful mother, and a woman of Godliness may her soul find peace and happiness
								throughout all eternity. </P>
								
								 
								<P> She passed away 21 February 1956 at Twin Falls, Idaho and was taken to Parker, Idaho where she was buried 26 of February 1956. </P>
