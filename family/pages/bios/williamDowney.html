								William Downey Sr immigrated from Scotland to Canada with his wife Mary Wilson.  He was killed at work 
								when he fell from the roof of the Tin Cap School Building during its construction.
								<p>
								"My father was William Downey Jr, born in Brockville, Ontario, Canada, 8 May 1838.  His father was a 
								carpenter and joiner and while working on the Tin Cap School House in Brockville, he fell from the 
								building and was killed.  Some one was asked to go tell his wife but by some error she had not been told 
								of his death and when the body was brought home to her, she was taken with convulsions which lasted 
								for several days and until after her little sone was born, which she named for his father, William Downey 
								(Jr).  The mother was cared for by kind neighbors.  A family by the name of Burns was particularly kind 
								and kept up the acquaintance with father.  After a few years his mother (Mary Willson Downey) married 
								an army captain, John Miles.
								<p>
								Father's Mother's maiden name was Mary Wilson but he never knew what family of Wilsons he belonged 
								to.  I am writing to see if in the year 1838 there was money deposited in this bank for Mrs. William Downey 
								and who the person was who deposited it.  I have been told there was money deposited for her by 
								someone of her family and it never was used and probably at a later date was taken back.  My father was 
								born 8 May 1838.  William Downey Jr came to Morristown, St. Lawrence, New York when a child 8 or 9 
								years old and lived hisentire life here.  He died in 1920 without knowing anything of his family.
								<p>
								Father was born in Brockville, Ontario, Canada.  He came to this country, USA, when he was 8 years old.  
								He came with a Frenchman named Roshette who lived in a cabin somewhere near the village of the Mill 
								road.  Mr. Roshette lived alone and felt that Billy should have a home, perhaps with some of the 
								surrounding farm families.
								<p>
								So it happened one day in harvest time that the threshing machine was at the Pringal place and MR. 
								Roshette said for Billy to go over ther where the men of the neighborhood were threshing and see if some 
								one of them might take Billy home with them.  So Billy went and I realy think Mr. Roshette had told him to 
								ask if there were any of the men that needed a boy to help them.  However, there was a Mr. John Bristow 
								there, and one of the men spoke up and said, "John, here is the boy you have been wanting."  Just a little 
								way off there was a field of grain and also some pigs running around loose and John Bristow said, "Let's 
								see if you can get those pigs out of the grain"  At that, Billy, eager to please scampered after the pigs and 
								got them even though he was a little barefooted boy and there were plenty of thistles.  There was a lot of 
								loud laughter and joking among the men, saying he's your boy John, etc.  However at the end of the day 
								and the men went home, John Bristow took Billy home with him and he was their adopted son and all the 
								older people knew him as Billy Downey.
								<p>
								The Bristow farm still belongs to the Downey family thru Carl and Jessie Downey Fay.  My father always 
								remembered the girl Mary Hindmarsh, who at that time was working fro the Bristows.  She evidently did 
								not like the idea of adding Billy to the family and said to Mr. Bristow, "I don't know why you brought that 
								little devil here."  Many years later I've heard my father laugh and tell her of it.  My father married her 
								youngest sister Sarah Hindmarsh."
								<p>
								A note from Caroline Dunn said, "Claire Garvin states Mary Wilson was of President Wilson's family.  (The 
								records could prove this true or false.)
