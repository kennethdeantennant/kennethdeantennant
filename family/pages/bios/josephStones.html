								<P>Joseph Aaron Stones was born in Florence, Nebraska 11 December 1860.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the son of Joseph Stones Sr. , who was born in England, 4 April 1826 and
								came to America as an immigrant and settled in Franklin, where father spent his younger life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was forth of a family of five, having three older sisters,
								and a younger brother who died in infancy.</P>
								
								<P>He never told us very much about his early life, but I do know his father was very strict with the family, and he being the only boy had much hard work to
								do.</P>
								
								<P>   In those days the harvesting was done with the cradle, as they called it (a scythe with a basket attached), and the bundles were bound with straw, an
								art that he taught us boys to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work in those days was in a large part done by oxen in his boyhood days, as there were not very many horses a that
								time.</P>
								
								<P>At the age of 25 he married Anna Eliza Housley, my mother, 2 may 1885, and later homesteaded a farm at Franklin, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here another history
								tells most of his life, written by Emma Housley Auger, Mother's niece, who know the family about as well as we knew ourselves, so I shall just jot down a
								few of the things that reveal the personal side of his character.</P>
								
								<P>His word was law to his family and good as a note to his friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expected his family to work hard as he had always done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved people, and did
								much for everyone moving into the community were he lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a lot of patience with everyone moving in to the community wherever he lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
								had a lot of patience with people, but not so much with stubborn animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quit religious and held many church positions, at one time bishop, and
								for many years as Bishop's counselor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also served as choir leader, and many other positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always had family prayer and had the family take
								turns in offering the prayer</P>
								
								
								<P>He was never very stable, but seemed to like to move from place to place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a good rough carpenter and improved the outbuildings wherever he
								went, but he never took so much interest in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed our barns and sheds were always better than our house, but every place was left better
								by his having live on it.</P>
								
								
								<P>He was an excellent marksman with a rifle and won many shooting contests and loved to hunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also was a lover of music, and at one time played a
								base violin in the Lowe Orchestra.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also played a flute and accordion; he was good bass singer, and often he and mother would sing together.</P>
								
								
								<P>Unlike his father, he did not take very much interest in beautifying and landscaping the yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever was done in this line was left up to mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His
								father was an ardent flower lover and gardener.</P>
								
								
								<P>He was a lover of good stock, and always improved whatever he had.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made great strides in developing his horses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when he only had
								four head of small horses, but in a few years he had some of the best in the country, and often he would trade with neighbors and match teams that
								would sell at premium prices.</P>
								
								
								<P>In his younger days he did much canyon work, getting wood for the home, school, also logs to make lumber, besides the farm work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also handy
								at cement work, and built many roads and bridges as road supervisor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the art of using dynamite for blasting to get the best results.</P>
								
								
								<P>He loved humor, and was always jesting, and joking with the neighbors and to tease the grandchildren and mother too, if he could find something to tease
								her about.</P>
								
								
								<P>It seemed he was gifted with the power in the priesthood to heal the sick and he was called often in this capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived a simple life and never cared
								for fancy things.</P>
								
								
								<P>He became crippled in his hip in his older years and had to use crutches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few years of his life he devoted to a little wood-chopping and reading
								church books and stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was always glad to have friends and neighbors visit him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died a few days after having a stroke 1 February 1944 at
								Franklin, Idaho and is buried in the Franklin Cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved to Franklin from Cambridge in 1930.</P>
