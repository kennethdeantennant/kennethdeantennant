								OBITUARY: CARRIE ELLA FISHER CHAPIN
								<p>
								Carrie Ella Fisher was born February 25th, 1860, in Plano, Illinois.   Herdeath
								occurred at Fairmont, Nebraska, November 25,1919, having attained to fifty-nine
								years and nine months.
								<p>
								In the spring of 1876 she moved with her parents to a farm near Fairmont.
								After teaching school for a year she was married to Frederick M. Chapin in
								1977.  For about twenty years farming continued to be the special interest of
								this new home,  Mrs. Chapin experienceing all the losses and disappointments
								and hardships of those days with loyailty and courage.  Three children were
								born into their home, Mrs. Harriet Akin of Fairmont, Mason I. Chapin of
								Riverton, Wyoming, and Guy E. Chapin of Oklahoma City.  The two boys had been
								privileged to visit their mother several months before she passed away as had a
								sister and other relatives.  These visits added much to the happiness and satis
								faction of Mrs. Chapin in her last weeks.
								<p>
								After moving to Fairmont from the farm, business interests occupied the home,
								Mrs. Chapin herself showing considerable business ability and entering into it
								to a limited extent.
								<p>
								Her general ability, her genius for life and for friendship are indicated in
								her relation to and work in the C.Gongregational Church, the Eastern Star and
								Royal Neighbor lodges, the P.E.O. Society and Stephen Bennett Chapter of the
								D.A.R., being a charter member in the last named order.
								<p>
								As suggestive of her human interest and practical work, she spent the earlier
								years of her life in town in nursing and at a time when return for such labor
								was little and the need was great.  Perhaps the best years of her life and the
								most self-denying, next to the twenty years which she gave to her own home and
								children, were the some fifteen or twenty years that she gave to the nursing
								and care of her aged father and mother.  It seemed always her work and missioon
								to give and to give her best and her all, which was herself.  This she did
								without lstint and without complaint.  She loved much, therefore she gave much.
								In recent years she has taken great interest and comfort in her grandchildren,
								of whom there are six, giving to them of her love and wisdom, deppened and
								ripened through a varied experience.  Loving life and work and friends as she
								did, she hoped did, she hoed almost to the last for strength and years in which
								to live her own life and do as her desires and ability prompted.  When,
								however, after two and a half years of constant, patient suffering, she
								realized that his was not to be, she expressed her faith in the Divine goodness
								and will and her readiness to go.
								<p>
								Flowers and friends and schoo children passing her window were her daily
								comforters and helped pass the weary hours.
								<p>
								"To give is to have."  Then she should have an abundance of enduring
								possessions.
								<p>
								"What is excellent, as God lives, is permanent.
								<p>
								Hearts are dust.<br>
								Heart's loves remain.<br>
								Heart's loves will meet thee again."<br>
								<p>
								The funeral services were held at the Congregational church on Thanksgiving
								Day, November 27th.  The well filled church was indicative of the respect in
								which the deceased was held by the community and of their deep sympathy for
								those who morn most her going.
								<p>
								Besides her husband and three children, she leaves a sister, Mrs Ira Allen of
								Sandwich, Illinois, and a brother George R. Fisher of Yorkville, Illinois.
								Those attending the service from out of town were George R. Fisher, Yorkville,
								Ill.; Mr. and Mrs. Guy E. Chapin of Oklahoma City; Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Chapin
								of Oklahoma City; W. W. Parish of Exeter, Mrs. Landy Clark of Lincoln, Mrs.
								Mary Akin and Miss Benta Akin of Fairbury.  F. M. Chapin and Children.

								This is the note found wrapped around a tintype photo graph of two young girls,
								"Mother (Carrie Ella Fisher) on right and cousin ?Janice? (Jennie) Fisher
								Brown, Uncle Mason Fisher's daughter.  Taken on Grandpa Fisher's (Oliver
								Persons Fisher) trip east just
								before they moved to Nebraska."  Comment: We can0ot read with clarity the name
								of the cousin.  There are some letters from cousin Jennie in the records.  It
								appears that the cousin is the daughter of Isaac Mason Fisher who is an uncle
								to Mason Isaac Chapin.
