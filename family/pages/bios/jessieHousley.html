								Jessie frederick Housley, the son of George Frederick and May Ann Buckley Baron Housley, was born in Hyrum, Cache, Utah 9 September 1897.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a
								good natured, happy child with a sunny disposition, which lasted througout his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was baptized 3 September 1365.<p></P>
								
								Hyrum second ward, where he lived, was on a hill in the southeast part of town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this ward, was a red brick school house where the children attended
								school from the beginners through second or third grades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here, they were expected to go down the hill to a school in the first ward to finish their
								grade schooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the public square at the foot of this hill was the first ward church house and two school buildings. <p></P>
								
								 
								<P> Now for several years as the second ward children passed their grades in the red brick school house and would cross over the big ditch, they were met by
								a bunch of bullies who would tease and tantalize them and sometimes throw stones or beat them severely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few of them ever got in to these higher
								grade schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie was one who was beaten badly and frightened out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His older brother, Ted, took over and frightened the bigger boys away and then
								went into the school room and knocked two or three of them down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then dared them ever to touch his brother again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher just looked on, but
								she was not very tactful as while Jessie was still frightened she told him not to come to school again until he had learned to write with his right hand, so
								that was the end of his schooling. </P>
								
								 
								<P> With his jovial disposition he developed the habit of teasing and joking, but not to the extent of harming anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time when his parents were going
								to Logan, they had outlined the work for each one of the children to do while they were away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie crawled under the buggy seat and stayed there until
								the team was  tied up in Logan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he crawled out laughing because he had got to come to Logan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His parents made him stay in the buggy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was
								punishment for him, but he laughed because he got out of the work this time even if he did get double next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quite a cut-up all of his life and was
								loved by all who knew him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew of medium height, but rather slim with blue eyes and bright red hair and a freckled face. </P>
								
								 
								<P> He was 38 years old when his father died.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He worked for quit some time for his brother-in-law, Clark Jackson, in Plano, Idaho before he was married.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
								ran a garage at Lava.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved nature, enjoyed fishing and hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time he made a dug-out in the mountain side and lived in it one winter. </P>
								
								 
								<P> On the 5   November 1919, he married Lean Hansen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the 19 December 1919, they received their endowments and were sealed in the Logan
								Temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four children were both to this union, one boy and three girls. </P>
								
								 
								<P> Lawyne H. Housley, born 27 March 1921 in Lewisville.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fern Lerine Housley, born 17 June 1922 in Menan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mazel Lorbe Housley, born 4 July 1924 in Grant
								Ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venna Virginia Housley, born 25 December 1929 in Hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All four children were born in Jefferson County, Idaho. </P>
								
								 
								<P> Soon after the birth of their last child, Jessie became very ill and was bed-fast for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed away 1 December 1933 of Brights Disease in
								Chester Field, Bannock, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 3  <SUP>rd</SUP> of December he was buried in Grand Ward, Jefferson, Idaho. </P>
