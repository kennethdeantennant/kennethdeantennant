								Husband: Bernard Boyle<br>
								Wife:    Unity McGarvey<br>
								<p>
								Children: 10 children - we can only find records of six children.
								<p>
								Children: Bernard Boyle - B 1833;  Mary Ann Boyle - B ????;
								<p>
								          Dominic Sylvester Boyle - B 23 Aug 1843;  Patrick Boyle - B 23 Aug<br>
								          1843 Twins;  John Boyle - B 12 Aug 1844;  Daniel Boyle - B ???<br>
								<p>
								Child 1 - Bernard Boyle
								<p>
								Jan. 1985 - From Aunte Kat's Scottish Birth Record, Bernard was born in 1833,
								County Donegal, Ireland.  Cecilia, Bernard's wife, was born 1837, County Mayo, Ireland.
								<p>
								They were married March 15, 1855 in Scotland.  Aunte Kate was their first child
								born April 2, 1856.
								<p>
								Jan. 1985 - Bernard was a coal miner, except in 1857 listed as iron miner on
								James' birth record.  John Boyle (nephew) put Cecilia's name on Kate's death
								Certificate as Sybol.  I belive this was derived from her nickname of Sibby -
								from Cecilia.  (Sybol was in error).
								<p>
								Child 2  Mary Ann Boyle
								<p>
								Child 3  Dominic Sylvester BOYLE
								<p>
								1360 Census states, "15 children born -- 7 living";  we have accounted for 12
								We believe Dominic and Anna were married in Scotland in about 1863.
								Anna was 18 years of age when Ellen was born, and 20 when John arrived (in
								Scotland).  They immigrated to America in 1870 with the two children.  Ten more
								children were born to them in Ohio, in and around Wellston.  John Boyle,
								brother to Dominic, (four years younger) also came to America and lived in New
								Straitsville, Ohio.
								<p>
								Dominic was a coal miner, and followed the mining work in Ohio.  When Dominic
								became sick with the "miners Disease" (black lung), he worked as a saloon
								keeper until his death in 1897.  Death certificate for Dominic listed his
								occupation as miner, and cause of death "consumption".
								<p>
								Martha Boyle (Edward's wife) said her father-in-law, Dominic was born a twin --
								per family history.  This may account for the fact that three sons previous to
								the birth of the twins were not named for him, but one of his twins was.  Both
								sets were name Dominic and Patrick.
								<p>
								Child 4  Patrick Boyle
								<p>
								Child 5  John Boyle<br>
								Marriage - St. Augustine Catholic Church.
								<p>
								From Kate 1965 - John left Ireland for Scotland when about ten years old.  He
								worked in the mines in Scotland before coming to America when he was about 26
								years old in 1870.
								<p>
								June 1880 census listed him as John Boyle age 33 from Ireland and was a saloon
								keeper.  Mary was 21 years with Eunice as 1 year old baby.
								<p>
								Mary had bright red hair, that showed up in numerous grandchildren.
								<p>
								Child 6  Daniel Boyle
								<p>
								This is all of the notes Donna Jean Boyle had on her records at the present
								time.
