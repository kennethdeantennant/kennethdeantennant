								Moved as a small boy to Indianapolis, Indiana, by covered wagon.  Later worked for 17 cents a day 
								gathering corn.  Joined Union Army at Laffeth, Indiana, Jan. 13. 1864 and served until the end of Civil 
								War (1865).  Was discharged from army, followed his mother and sister to Missouri and arrived May 2, 
								1866.  Lived about six miles east of Oregon, Missouri, near the Norvell home for about two years.  He 
								started school under Prof. Cummins at Oregon, Missouri with second reader and learned fast.  Went 
								about two years.  He met his future wife for the first time while sitting ujp all night over the corpse of a 
								neighbor.  Sarah Dunkle Norvell was the other party to be asked to sit up with the same corpse.  (Often 
								wonder if someone was not playing cupid.)
								<p>
								Sarah noted how still and soldier like he was.  Horace in turn noted how fair complected she was and 
								soon thought she was the best looking girl he ever knew.  He fell in love almost at once.  It wasn't long 
								before he asked to let him see her home after church.  She replied, "Ask father."  So, he got permission 
								from Uncle Jackie Norvell.
