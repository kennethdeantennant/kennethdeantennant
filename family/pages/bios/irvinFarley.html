								Irvin Housley Farley was born 8 October 1895 at Ogden, Weber County, Utah the son of Lorenzo and Julia Housley Farley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the fourth child of
								this family of thirteen, which included six brothers and six sisters.
								<P> At the tender age of seven, he went to live with his uncle, Ben Housley, in Cache Valley, Utah where he was taught the basic fundamentals of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
								training was never forgotten because he has worked all his life and championed good work habits.</P>
								<P> Bishop Farley received his early education in schools in and near Ogden, and while on many occasions of the wonderful associations which he had with this
								great man, now Prophet and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think that this association had a lasting influence for
								good on Bishop Farley.</P>
								<P> He met Hannah Clair Cooper in Salt Lake City, Utah while he was attending Barber School, and she was attending the university of Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were
								married on the 23  <SUP>rd</SUP> of July 1919.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved to Delta, Utah, where he began his long career of barbering.</P>
								<P> Two children were born to this family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belda Maxine was born on 13 April 1920 at Fillmore, Utah, and Irvin Howard was born 14 October   1922 at Salt
								Lake City, Utah.</P>
								<P> Bishop Farley barber in Salt Lake City for a time and then the family moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho in October of 1923.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they remained for twenty
								seven years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during the early years in Idaho Falls that he taught his family the love of God and nature, for he dearly loved to go camping and
								fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always spoke of these trips with fond memories.</P>
								<P> Brother and Sister Farley moved to Missoula in 1950, and after a trip or two to Bitter Root Valley, fell in love with it's scenic beauty, and consequently
								moved to Corvallis in 1951.</P>
								<P> Their first church activity in the Bitterroot was at the Hamilton Branch, and when in 1954 the Corvallis Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ was organized, Brother Farley was called to be the first branch clerk, serving under
								President George R. Ellsworth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Ellsworth moved to Idaho Falls in August of 1956, he was called to serve as counselor in the Branch
								Presidency.</P>
								<P> Bishop Irvin H. Farley was ordained an High Priest the 16  <SUP>th</SUP> of June 1957 at the time when the Missoula Stake and the Corvallis Ward was organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
								served as counselor in the Bishopric under my (Don R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merkley) direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my absence of six months during the fall and winter of 1957 to 1958,
								Brother Farley was called to be acting bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been proud of the way the business was transacted during my absence.</P>
								<P> Bishop Farley never declined a call to serve the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was his life, and he loved to serve - to do his part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Sister Farley were called to work as
								Stake missionaries, and there are many members today because of their valiant efforts.</P>
								<P> Brother Farley was called to be the Bishop of the Corvallis Ward on 11 September   1960, and served admirably in that capacity until his release on 21 July
								  1963.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his release as Bishop of the ward, he was called to serve as Secretary to President Grant K. Patten in the Stake High Priests Quorum, and was
								holding this position at the time of his passing.</P>
								<P> Bishop Irvin Housley Farley is survived by his dear wife, Hannah Clair, residing here in Corvallis, and their two children, Mrs. Kermit (Relda) Rice, Hamilton
								of Montana and Irvin Howard, who now resides in Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have seven grandchildren.</P>

								Ernest (Mildred) Bradshaw of St. Anthony, Idaho; Mrs. Elmo (Lora) Green of Twin Falls, Idaho; Mrs. Leland (Edith) Miller of Kellogg, Idaho.</P>
								<P> He was preceded in death by his father who died in December 1916 at Parker, Idaho and his mother, who died in 1956 at Twin Falls, Idaho.</P>
								<P> Bishop Farley loved the land and loved to garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a special know-how with flowers, and many times provided beautiful boquest for the chapel,
								and took them to the homes of the elderly and the sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved to work with animals, and always took good care of them.</P>
								<P> And last of all, he was a champion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and a friend too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was my friend.</P>
