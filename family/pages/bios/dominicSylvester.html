								Donna Jean Boyle's record shows Dominic Sylvester Boyle Sr. -172, birth 23
								August 1843 as having died 3 March 1897 where as this record shows death date
								as being 3 Sept 1897.  As of today, 4 Sept 1994, I do not know which date is
								more correct.
								<p>
								In 1964 or 1965, I James Chapin Downey, went to Welston, Jackson, Ohio to find
								my Dominic Sylvester Boyle Sr's grave and any record I could find about him.  I
								<p>
								looked at both the Welston Cemetary, and the Cathlic Church Cemetary, looking
								at available records and looking at every headstone at the Welston Cemetary
								without finding his grave.  The sexton said the records were burned in the fire
								distroying the building there at the Cemetary.  The sexton did not advise me to
								walk up and down the rows of headstones looking for my great-grandfather
								because of the cotton mouth snakes.  I had already walked up and down the rows
								of headstones between the hours of 6 am and 8 am when the sexton arrived for
								his daily activities.  After going to the Cathlic cemetary and returning to the
								sexton, I asked him if there were any other cemetaries in the area that Grandpa
								might be buaried.  He said there was a very old cemetary west of town on a
								little mound that was very heavely grown over by underbrush.  He said it would
								be imposable to find most of the headstones because of overgrowth and cotton
								moth snakes.  So I went to Katheryn Linch's home Steightsville for a visit.

								March 17, 1999  Donna Jean Boyle of 1006 West Fremont Ave of Riverton, Wyoming - wrote the following:
								<p>
								Happy St. Patrick's Day!!
								<p>
								Let me give you a little bit of history.  Dominic Boyle was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Ireland, 
								on August 23, 1843.  Anna Lenor McGoff was born in County Mayo, Ireland, on December 25, 1846.   
								The potato famine hit Ireland in 1846, so both the Boyle and McGoff families immigrated to Scotland.  In 
								1863, Dominic married Anna in Scotland, and they had two children there, Ellen and John.  In 1870, this 
								family of four, with Dominic's single brother John, immigrated to the United States.
								<p>
								Dominic and Anna lived 29 years in Ohio where Dominic and his brother John worked in the coal mines.  
								Younger brother John Boyle married Mary Beerman and they had nine (9) children.  Anna had ten (10) 
								more children before Dominic died on black lung in 1897, Wellston, Ohio.  They also buried five children 
								in Ohio!
								<p>
								In 1899, jobs in the coal mines were getting scarce in Ohio, so Anna's oldest son John and her son-in-law, 
								William Hotchkiss urged widow Anna Boyle to move the family west to find work in the mines of the Union 
								Pacific Railroad.  Making the train journey were:  Anna Lenor McGoff Boyle (age 53); Son John Boyle 
								(age 33); daughter Anna Boyle Hotchkiss (age 28) with her husband, William Hotchkiss and their two 
								sons, Errol and Donald;  son Charles Francis Boyle (age 25); son Dominic Boyle (age 23) with his wife 
								Bessie and their daughter Maymie;  daughter Margaret Boyle (age 18); son Edward Boyle (age 17); and 
								daughter Mary Agnes Boyle (age 13).  THEY ARRIVED IN KEMMERER, WYOMING, IN OCTOBER OR 
								NOVEMBER, 1899 -  ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO!  The John Boyle family remained in Ohio, but the 
								families remained close for one generation.
