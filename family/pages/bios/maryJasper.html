								John "Jack" Norvell and Mary Polly Jasper were married Sept. 6, 1837.  They had	
								five (5) children according to our records from Paul Larkam.  See family group
								sheet.
								<p>
								Polly, as  she was best known, died some time between 1848 and 1853.
								<p>
								John Norvell remarried Sophronia Ann Harris March 3, 1853.  Paul Larkam's note
								on the subject says, "John 'Jack' Norvell remarried after the death of Polly
								Jasper Norvell."
								<p>
								Jack and Sophronia Ann Harris 1825 to 1892, had six (6) children.  See family
								group sheet.
								<p>
								Corrections on death date for Mary Polly Jasper submitted by Sue Lund of Mill
								Valley, California, 25 January 1994.
								<p>
								She says:  Polly was still alive according to the 1850 census.  Paul's papers
								stated Polly died July 4, 1853, a date we double-checked when we returned for
								our second visit to review his research.  Since John remarried to Sophronia
								Harris on May 15, 1853, the year for Polly's death is incorrect.  I suspect
								July 4 is correct but the year to have been 1852 or perhaps 1851.  John and
								Polly had a daughter Mary "Polly" born 1848 or perhaps a little later since
								Sarah Dunkle was born 1847; therefore, a child born 1851 or 1852 would be
								likely.  This child died, sex unknown, and Polly died soon after from "Quick
								TB" according to Paul's records.
