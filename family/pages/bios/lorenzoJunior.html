								<P>Brother Lorenzo Farley in our ward has lived a full and fascinating life, and has also traced the rich history of his ancestors and has discovered their good lives.<BR>
								<BR>
								</P>
								
								<P>Brother Farley has traced his lines back thirteen generations and has found inspiration in the stories he has uncovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Farley come over from Ireland in
								1600 on the ship Horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother Farleys paternal grandfather was the first wheelwright in Ogden, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His maternal great-grandmother came from
								Copenhagen, Denmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She traveled across the plains with her family in the Martin Handcart Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 250 of them left Iowa, but only 52 arrived in
								Salt Lake City.</P>
								
								<P>Before the Salt Lake temple was built, endowments were given in the Endowment House, and Brother Farleys mothers parents received them there and were
								sealed in 1862.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His grandfather, George Housley, was the one who brought the paper out that the first Deseret News was printed on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought it from St.
								Louis, Missouri by wagon on 15 June 1851.
								</P>
								
								<P>His grandfather was always helping people, visiting the sick and needy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often would say, "I don't see why they always call me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll not go another time."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
								whenever there was a call, he always responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a great testimony of the gospel, and he would often sing a hymn on Fast Sunday because he felt
								weakness in speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he disagreed with his wife, he would put on his hat and go for a walk, and would return saying, "May I please come in?"
								</P>
								
								<P>Brother Farley spoke about the Indians of Utah in the time of the pioneers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told how the Indians would always come around and beg for bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pioneers
								had been counseled by general authorities to give them what they asked for and never harm them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Brigham Young, "Never turn them down,
								never make an Indian mad."
								</P>
								
								<P>Brother Farley himself was born in Ogden Utah, on 11 July 1889.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the oldest of 13 children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his parents were married, his father was 20 and his
								mother was 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was only 14 when he was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew up mainly in Utah and Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of six, he started working in his dads blacksmith shop
								pumping bellows to keep the fire going.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would start to work three hours before breakfast and then he would go to school, and he would return to work after
								he got home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days, a work day was from 16 to 18 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times he would be so tired that he couldn't sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to school through the eighth
								grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he never went to high school, he learned quite a bit; he was studying trigonometry in the eighth grade.
								</P>
								
								<P>He went to Idaho to work for his mothers brother on the church cattle ranch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, his parents moved to Idaho Falls and he followed them and went to work
								for a blacksmith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 15, he went to work for David O. McKay on a dairy farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, David O. McKay was a professor in Ogden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother
								Farley remembers how he would have breakfast with the McKays and the many times he had dinner with them and the fun they had.
								</P>
								
								<P>Brother Farley's father wanted him to learn the blacksmith trade, but he didn't like it, so he went into carpentry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started building covered wagons, and he
								explained the complicated work of bowling a wagon wheel; fitting it on the hot iron tire and then immersing it in cold water.
								</P>
								
								<P>In 1913, Brother Farley moved to Nevada, but soon returned to Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had been married in 1910 in the Salt Lake Temple, and in 1915 life brought his family
								to California and he went to work for the railroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He worked as a passenger car inspector, doing light repair work on the cars and was employed by them for 43
								years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his spare time, with the help of his sons, he built a five room house in Monterey Park, which he traded for the one which he owns now in San Gabriel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He commented on this home, "This is the only home Ive ever known and appreciated."
								</P>
								
								<P>Brother Farley had three children, and then his first wife passed away in 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remarried to Melissa Fransen in 1952 and they had the opportunity to travel
								all over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Brother Farley put it, "We traveled the U.S. from north to south and east to west."
								</P>
								
								<P>Brother Farley has lived a full life and although he is now confined to his home, he still greets friends and visitors with a happy youthful spirit.</P>
