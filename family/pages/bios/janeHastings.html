											Was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Easter Sunday in April 1849.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this time
										her son Thomas, died and shortly after his death their father left home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family never heard from him for almost seven years and during this time
										her daughter, Eliza died, leaving only four children in the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1861 a letter came to the family from the father telling them that he was in
										America and had been working to make enough money to send them for their passage to come and join him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left their home in England 10 April
										and sailed on the ship Manchester, taking four weeks to cross the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They joined the Joseph Horn Company and the father joined them in St. Joseph,
										Missouri, taking about four months to cross the plains, walking all the way except when riding for protection from dangerous situations such as:
										Johnson's Army and encounters with hostile Indians.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She endured many hardships but was valiant and faithful through it all, teaching her family the
										Gospel of Jesus Christ.
