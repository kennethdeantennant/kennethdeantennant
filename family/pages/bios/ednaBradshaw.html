								Edna Mildred Farley was born in Ogden, Cache County, Utah on 17 January 1361 as the seventh child of Lorenzo and Julia
								Farley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next 14 years gave her six more brothers and sisters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of her early life is spent in Ogden and Paradise,
								Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among her early memories was helping to look after her youngest brother, Merwin, while her mother helped her
								blacksmith father support the large family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She enjoyed a close association with her brothers and sisters, which association
								she held in high esteem all her life.<p></P>
								
								
								<P>She loved her parents, but was to lose her father when she was only 16 after the family moved to Parker, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in
								Parker she met Carl Albert (Algot) Neilson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He later joined the LDS Church and on 6 June 1918, they were married in the Salt
								Lake Temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made their first home on a dry farm at Sand Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That same year, she contacted the flu that claimed
								so many lives, but fortunately survived the illness.</P>
								
								
								<P>In 1922, she moved with her first three children to Glenn's Ferry, Idaho where Albert had obtained employment with the
								railroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the fourth child Ray was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years they moved back and forth between Parker, Heman, and
								St. Anothony, finally moving with six children to Burke, Idaho where her husband could work in the silver mines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the
								depression, they moved with seven children to Twin Falls, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last of eight children, Helen Marie, was born to them
								there.</P>
								
								
								<P>The first 62 years of her life were years of struggle and hardship, but her life changed for the better when in 1963 she met a
								recent widower, Ernest Bradshaw, whom she married on the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of September.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her new husband gave her a new lease on life
								that was one of joyous and invigorating living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two have been able to fill a void in each other's life that proved to be a
								blessing to both Mother and Ernest during the remainder of their married life, which lasted five years.</P>
								
								
								<P>Her life was one of interest in serving - having spent many years teaching and working in the Primary and Relief Society
								where she was serving at the time of her sudden call home on 17 October 1968 while engaged at work at the side of her good
								husband where she loved to be.</P>
								
								
								<P>She is survived in this life by her husband, Ernest Bradshaw, five sons - Delbert Augustus Neilson of Bellflower, California,
								Ray Edward Neilson of Salt Lake City, Utah; Oscar Grant Neilson of Archer, Idaho; Darwin Max Neilson of Twin Falls, Idaho;
								Morris Earl Neilson of Slat Lake City, Utah; three daughters - Ruth Lena Scott of Denver, Colorado; Verla LaRue Finke of
								Everett, Washington; and Helen Marie Tennant, Twin Falls, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three surviving brothers, Lorenzo Farley Junior
								of San Gabriel, California; Willard Farley of Boise, Idaho; Lawrence Farley of Parer, Idaho; two sisters - Laura Green of Twin
								Falls, Idaho; Edith Miller of Kellog, Idaho; one step-son - Seth Bradshaw of St. Anthony, Idaho; two step-daughters - Hilda
								Fowler of Rexburg, Idaho; Althea Brich of St. Anthony, Idaho; 34 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren; 20 step-grandchildren and 28 step-great-grandchildren.</P>
