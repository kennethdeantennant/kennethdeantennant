								Ruth was born 8 June 1919 in Parker, Idaho to the parents of Carl Albert Neilson and Edna Mildred Farley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the oldest of eight children.</p>
								
								 
								<P> Ruth's childhood was pretty much normal for the time period in which she was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did have meningitis at the age of about two or three years. 
								This was followed by lumbar pneumonia along with the usual childhood diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seemed to set the pattern of her life as far as health problems
								were concerned. </P>
								
								 
								<P> She was graduated from the eight grade in Twin Falls, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She met and married Henry Dick Jr. at the age of sixteen on May 18, 1935 in Twin Falls,
								Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had three children:   Jack M. Dick, Florence Edna Mitchell, and Allen M. Dick. </P>
								
								 
								<P> They lived in Twin Falls where Jack was born, then moved to Filer, Idaho where Florence was born, and then moved to Jerome, Idaho where Allen was
								born.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved to Nevada for a short time during World War II where Henry worked on bomb shelters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there they moved to Astoria, Oregon
								and ship yards in Astoria.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a greater need to have him work on the big ships that were being built in Portland, Oregon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they moved to
								Vanport, Oregon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanport was a federal housing area for people that worked in the shipyards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth worked as a waitress in various restaurants at this
								period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war was over Henry went to Alaska and worked on the underground bomb storage's for a period of six to eight months. </P>
								
								 
								<P> It was hard on the family to have him gone but he made good money, and that is what they needed at this time of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Henry
								returned home from Alaska, Vanport was flooded out, and they lost all that they had and had to start over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved to Lake Grove, Oregon to start
								their lives over. </P>
								
								 
								<P> It had to be very hard on them at this time of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rented a place for a period of time, and then they were able to buy a small house a few
								miles from where they rented. </P>
								
								 
								<P> It was at this time that Ruth and Henry began having marital problems that resulted in a divorce in 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth left the family and no one knew where
								she was or what she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family didn't know if she was alone or dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally came back to see her children after about eight yeas absence. </P>
								
								 
								<P> She never talked about her time away from home except to say that she lived in Denver, Colorado for a while and then lived near her dad in Tulsa,
								Oklahoma.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she did live in Vinita, Oklahoma. </P>
								
								 
								<P> While back in Portland, she met a man by the name of Peter Glenn Scott and they seemed to be quite happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They married in Vancouver, Washington
								on 5 July 1967.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they were divorced a short time later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth worked as a caretaker for the elderly at this time of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She retired a short
								time later and lived in Portland until she passed away on 5 November 1993 in her apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autopsy revealed that she died from a massive heart
								seizure. </P>
								
								 
								<P> There are three surviving sons and daughters, 12 grandchildren, 13 great-great-grandchildren and seven brothers and sisters. </P>
