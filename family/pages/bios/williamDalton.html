								INFORMATION WRITTEN BY JESSIE DOWNEY FAY:
								<p>
								RE- THE DALTONS
								<p>
								John, William, and Mary Dalton were our ancestors on the Dalton side of our
								family.  Mary Dalton Hindmarsh was our grandmother- came from England with her
								parents and one brother, William Jr. when she was 16 years old,  landing in
								Morristown always within 3 miles of the River St. Lawrence.
								<p>
								John Dalton, the oldest son, had come to America some time before 1823.  His
								father wanted so much to see him that the family decided to come.  I heard
								grandma say her father was so disheartened he could not eat and only lived 9
								days after landing.  He said "Oh, this wooden country.  I wish I had never seen
								it."  He also said his son John lived in a house not as good as the pig pen in
								England.
								<p>
								Mary Dalton Married Joseph Hindmarsh Nov. 17, 1824.  Married by Thomas Hill Esq<br>
								Joseph S. Hindmarsh born 18 Aug 1802.<br>
								Mary Dalton Hindmarsh born 17 Nov. 1807.<br>
								These are names of Joseph and Mary's family:<br>
								<p>
								John Hindmarsh born 26 Feb. 1829.<br>
								Mary Hindmarsh Heminway born 26 Oct. 1831.<br>
								Elizabeth Hindmarsh Sweetland born 19 July 1833.<br>
								Jane Hindmarsh Bailey born 25 Aug. 1835.<br>
								Rachel Hindmarsh Narcross born 28 Aug. 1838.<br>
								Sarah Hindmarsh Downey born 12 Oct. 1840.<br>
								Percy Dalton Hindmarsh born 25 Aug. 1842.<br>
								<p>
								John Dalton went west and we lost track of the family of Daltons.  William
								Dalton's family went to Canada and there was quite a large family of them.  His
								wife's first name was Janet.  We knew his son George's family very well.
								George and Clarissy had a large family, 9 children.  They used to live in the
								country perhaps 5 miles below Brockville, Canada.  There was a country church
								in their community in which they were very active.  Their daughter Mary married
								George Dudley and she and her family are still living quite near Brockville.
								They were farmers.  The rest of the family are living Calgary, North Canada.
								There are Jim Dalton's family - two sons last known to be in Ottawa, Canada.
								<p>
								Wish I knew for sure just where in England our Daltons came from.  Think it was
								either North or South Hampton.  Have heard that John Dalton, Brockville, had
								<p>
								done some research on his family.  John has been dead for several years and his
								widow married again and lives near Brockville.  Her given name is ALICE.
